          <h4>Transcending Statistics: Empowerment through Education</h4>
          <p>
          After my parents' divorce in Puerto Rico in 2006, my mom relocated with my younger sister and I to NYC. Six years later, my single parent household expanded by 1 when my younger brother was born. As the eldest, it meant I took on the responsibility of translating government documents even before reaching puberty. It also meant taking up part-time jobs throughout high school to contribute towards the household bills. Throughout my upbringing, my mother always emphasized the importance of education.
          <p>
          My mother grew up in Los Alcarrizos, Dominican Republic, where she witnessed the dangers faced by women. According to a UNICEF-sponsored study, 57% of Dominican women marry as teenagers, primarily due to poverty, illiteracy, and limited opportunities. This normalization of child marriage perpetuates the cycle of intergenerational poverty, as the burden of living expenses is passed on to the male partner. Consequently, it results in the objectification of human life, subjecting these young brides to a life of servitude, household maintenance, and domestic abuse.

          Dropping out of school before reaching high school was a difficult choice my mother had to make in order to provide for her family's basic needs. At the age of 22, I achieved a Masters of Science in Information Systems, becoming part of the 8% of Latinos in the US who hold a master's degree.
