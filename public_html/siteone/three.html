            My journey with web development began during the final semester of my undergraduate academic career. At the time I felt I lacked career trajectory, that I was stuck with my past major because COVID-19 made it impossible to socialize and explore other options.

Rymer highlighted the significance of creatives in the technological realm, emphasizing our unique ability to bring forth insights in unconventional ways.

            As someone who embraces lifelong learning, I believe it is crucial to continuously challenge myself.

To be part of the technology industry means to adapt and thrive amidst the constant transformations shaping our future.
