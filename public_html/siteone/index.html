    <div id="subheading">I used to define myself as a traditional artist because most of my work is created in forms of paintings or sculptures, but I think web devlopment has changed that for me. Hopefully you've already taken the liberty to view the other pages so that you can understand my statement a bit better. Web development has become my renewing canvas, with the power of HTML, JS, and CSS I've been able to recreate and destroy as many pages as I please. </div>
    <div id="desc">My most recent art accomplishment, besides my beautiful website, was having 3 gouache paintings of my family dog showcased at The Living Gallery in Brooklyn, NY.</div>

    <div id="paintings"><img src="../img/paintings.png" alt="3 colorful paintings of Brady"></div>

    <div id="paintings_bio"> When my family first adopted Brady, my mother feared his aggressive and playful nature. Oftentimes, I find myself reassuring her that he is nothing but silly and sweet in his own, unique way.<br> These paintings aim to focus on the vibrancy and range of color. Choosing to place the subjects in a bold enviornment reflects the intensity of emotions Brady brings to me. <br>Gouache paint on Canvas, 8x10 </div>
