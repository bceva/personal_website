      <div id="paintings_bio"> When my family first adopted Brady, my mother feared his aggressive and playful nature. Oftentimes, I find myself reassuring her that he is nothing but silly and sweet in his own, unique way. These paintings aim to focus on the vibrancy and range of color. Choosing to place the subjects in a bold enviornment reflects the intensity of emotions Brady brings to me. <p>Gouache paint on canvas, 8x10 </div>
